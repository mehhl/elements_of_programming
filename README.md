# elements_of_programming
My read-along of Stepanov and McJones' _Elements of Programming_ (2019). I started reading the book because I was missing three things:
* C++
* Philosophy
* Reading for pleasure
  
My read-along will reflect my attempt to satisfy all three of those needs, perhaps to the detriment of other qualities one might care about.
